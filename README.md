This a relatively simple sudoku solver I have written, largely for myself, but it may be of use to you too!

My main aim is to have it solve sudoku puzzles as a human would, just faster and better at keeping track of possibilities, and tell you exactly what it has done so you can follow along and learn.

It can also act as a helper: the .step() method will solve just one more cell, to give you a helping hand.

Still to do:
-Actually write the program.
-Think of an acronym for a name
